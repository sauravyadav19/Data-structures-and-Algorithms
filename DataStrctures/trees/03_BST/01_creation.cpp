/*
    * In arrays, Binary Search cost us O((log n)) but insertion and deletion is costly (shifting of Element)
    * In Linked List, The insertion and Deletion is easy but the traversal itself cost us O(n)

    * To overcome their individual challanges and get the best of the world, that is 
        => Searching is easy 
        => Insertion and Deletion is easy
    * The new Data strcture that has both of these properties is Binary Search Tree(BST).

    BINARY SEARCH TREE:
        => As the name suggest, it is a binary tree, meaning, at any node at most it can have 2 children.
        => but what truly makes BST shines is that, at any given node its
            => children to the left is always smaller than that of the parent node and
            => children to the right are always bigger then that of the parent node.

                                    ----------------
                                    |  parent Node |
                                    ----------------
                                    /               \
                                   /                 \
                                Smaller             Bigger
